### üß± Structs & Enums

#### üì¶ Structs

| Struct             | Purpose                                                           |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FMP_ChatMessage`  | Stores chat message data: sender, body, timestamp, channel, etc.  |

## üß† Architecture & Replication Model

* Each chat room is one replicated actor (`AMP_ChatRoom`), spawned on the server.
* Clients receive that actor **only if they've joined the room**.
* This filtering is handled using `IsNetRelevantFor()` to decide which clients should see the actor.
* Global rooms can be marked as `bAlwaysRelevant = true` to make them visible to all.

> This design ensures minimal bandwidth, no duplicated actors, and room-specific visibility ‚Äî scalable and efficient.

---

## üõ´ Getting Started

### üì• Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yuvi-GD/MP_ChatSystem.git
```

1. Copy the `MP_ChatSystem` folder into your project's `Plugins/` directory.
2. Open your project ‚Üí **Edit ‚û° Plugins ‚û° Enable "MP\_ChatSystem"**
3. Restart Unreal Editor when prompted.

---

### üõ† Usage

1. **Place `AMP_ChatManager`** in your level (or spawn it via GameMode).
2. In your PlayerController Blueprint, **implement `IMP_Chat_PlayerController_I`**

   * Define `GetSenderID()` and `GetSenderName()`.
3. Add `UMP_ChatBox` to your widget hierarchy.
4. On input: call a Server RPC ‚Üí Manager ‚Üí Room ‚Üí `AddChatMessage(...)`
5. Bind `AMP_ChatRoom::OnMessageReceived` to a Widget function for UI updates.

---

## üß™ Replication Flow

1. Client sends message ‚Üí RPC ‚Üí `AMP_ChatManager`
2. Manager finds correct `AMP_ChatRoom`
3. Server calls `Room->AddChatMessage(...)`
4. Message is added to `FMP_ChatMsgArray`
5. `MarkItemDirty(...)` triggers FastArray delta replication
6. Client receives `OnRep_Messages()` and dispatches to UI

---

## üßº Best Practices

* Use `IsNetRelevantFor()` to control who receives which room
* Use `bAlwaysRelevant = true` for global chat
* Use `ForceNetUpdate()` and `FlushNetDormancy()` after join/subscription
* Never spawn room actors on clients manually ‚Äî server handles replication
* Avoid calling expensive logic (e.g., Blueprint interfaces) inside `Tick` or `IsNetRelevantFor()` if not needed
