# MP_ChatSystem - Multiplayer Chat System Plugin for Unreal Engine

MP_ChatSystem is a powerful, efficient, and modular multiplayer chat system built for Unreal Engine.
Supports Global, Team, Party, and Private (DM) channels with a room-based design and highly optimized message replication — ideal for both Listen Server and Dedicated Server projects, it's Scalable, extendable, and open-source.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 💬 Structured support for **Global**, **Team**, **Party**, and **Private (DM)** chat
* 🧩 Room-based system: clean isolation of conversations and channels
* 📡 Network-efficient via **FastArray Replication** — not RPC per message
* 🔀 Supports **temporary** and **persistent** rooms per use case
* 🧠 Client-specific **relevancy filtering** — only receive what you need
* 🎛️ Full runtime control: create, join, route messages through code or UI
* 🖼️ Built-in **scrollable chat box system** for easy UI integration
* ⚙️ Easy to extend, debug, and customize for games, simulation, and more

## 🧠 Architecture & Replication Model

* Each chat room is one replicated actor (`AMP_ChatRoom`), spawned on the server.
* Clients receive that actor **only if they've joined the room**.
* This filtering is handled using `IsNetRelevantFor()` to decide which clients should see the actor.
* Global rooms can be marked as `bAlwaysRelevant = true` to make them visible to all.

> This design ensures minimal bandwidth, no duplicated actors, and room-specific visibility — scalable and efficient.

## 🛫 Getting Started

### 📥 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yuvi-GD/MP_ChatSystem.git
```

1. Copy the `MP_ChatSystem` folder into your project's `Plugins/` directory.
2. Open your project → **Edit ➡ Plugins ➡ Enable "MP\_ChatSystem"**
3. Restart Unreal Editor when prompted.

---

### 🛠 Usage

1. **Place `AMP_ChatManager`** in your level (or spawn it via GameMode).
2. In your PlayerController Blueprint, **implement `IMP_Chat_PlayerController_I`**

   * Define `GetSenderID()` and `GetSenderName()`.
3. Add `UMP_ChatBox` to your widget hierarchy.
4. On input: call a Server RPC → Manager → Room → `AddChatMessage(...)`
5. Bind `AMP_ChatRoom::OnMessageReceived` to a Widget function for UI updates.

---

## 🧪 Replication Flow

1. Client sends message → RPC → `AMP_ChatManager`
2. Manager finds correct `AMP_ChatRoom`
3. Server calls `Room->AddChatMessage(...)`
4. Message is added to `FMP_ChatMsgArray`
5. `MarkItemDirty(...)` triggers FastArray delta replication
6. Client receives `OnRep_Messages()` and dispatches to UI

---

## 🧼 Best Practices

* Use `IsNetRelevantFor()` to control who receives which room
* Use `bAlwaysRelevant = true` for global chat
* Use `ForceNetUpdate()` and `FlushNetDormancy()` after join/subscription
* Never spawn room actors on clients manually — server handles replication
* Avoid calling expensive logic (e.g., Blueprint interfaces) inside `Tick` or `IsNetRelevantFor()` if not needed
